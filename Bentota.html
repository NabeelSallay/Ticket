                        <h2>The Bentota Turtle Hatchery</h2>
                        <p>The Bentota Turtle Hatchery, also known as the Kosgoda Turtle Conservation Project, is a well-known turtle conservation initiative located in Kosgoda, near Bentota, on the southwestern coast of Sri Lanka. The hatchery focuses on the protection and rehabilitation of sea turtles and their eggs.</p>

                                <h3>Nest Protection</h3>
                                <p>The hatchery collects sea turtle eggs from vulnerable nesting sites along the coast and relocates them to protected hatcheries. This helps to safeguard the eggs from predation, poaching, and natural threats until they hatch.</p>

                            <div class="Home-page">

                                <h3>Conservation and Research</h3>
                                <p>The hatchery conducts research and monitors sea turtle populations in the region. They track nesting patterns, growth rates, and migration patterns to better understand the behavior and conservation needs of these marine creatures.</p>

                                <h3>Hatchling Release</h3>
                                <p> Once the eggs hatch, the hatchery releases the baby turtles into the sea during scheduled events. This gives the hatchlings a better chance of survival by minimizing predation and providing a safer environment for their initial journey.</p>
