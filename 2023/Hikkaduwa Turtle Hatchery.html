                        <p>The Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery is a popular tourist attraction and conservation project located in Hikkaduwa, a coastal town in Sri Lanka.

                        <h2>The Goal</h2>
                        <p>The primary goal of the hatchery is to provide a safe environment for turtle eggs to hatch and release the baby turtles into the sea. The hatchery collects eggs that are vulnerable to poaching or other threats and keeps them in protected areas until they are ready to hatch. Once the baby turtles emerge from their shells, they are released into the ocean.</p>
