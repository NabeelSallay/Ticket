                                <h3>Conservation Efforts</h3>
                                <p>The Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery is primarily focused on conserving and protecting sea turtles, which are endangered species. The hatchery aims to raise awareness about the importance of turtle conservation and the threats they face in their natural habitats.</p>

                                <h3>Turtle Rehabilitation</h3>
                                <p>The hatchery rescues and rehabilitates injured turtles that are brought in by local fishermen, tourists, or other individuals. They provide necessary medical treatment and care for the injured turtles until they are ready to be released back into the sea.</p>

                                <h3>Turtle Hatchery</h3>
                                <p>Visitors can observe turtle eggs and baby turtles in various stages of development at the hatchery. The eggs are collected from vulnerable nesting sites and placed in protected hatcheries until they hatch. This ensures their safety from predators and other hazards.</p>
