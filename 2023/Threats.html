        <h5>The Turtle Population in Sri Lanka</h5>
        <p>Sri Lanka's turtle populations have faced serious threats over the years including habitat destruction, pollution, illegal fishing practices, and poaching for meat, eggs, and shellfish. These factors have led to declining turtle populations in many areas.However,Sri Lanka has taken several conservation measures to protect its turtle populations. Efforts include creating marine sanctuaries, enforcing tough anti-poaching and egg harvesting laws, raising awareness among local communities, and promoting sustainable fishing practices.</p>

                <h3>Nesting Habitat Loss</h3>
                <p>Coastal development and human activities pose a significant threat to turtle nesting beaches. The construction of hotels, resorts, and other infrastructure along the coast can destroy or disturb nesting sites.</p>

                <h3>Egg Poaching</h3>
                <p>The illegal collection of turtle eggs for consumption or sale is a significant threat to turtles in Sri Lanka. Poachers often raid nests, which reduces the chances of successful hatching and lowers the population of these endangered species.</p>

                <h3>Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs)</h3>
                <p>TEDs are crucial tools used in fishing nets to prevent the accidental capture and entanglement of marine animals, including turtles. However, the lack of enforcement and compliance with regulations mandating the use of TEDs by local fishermen poses a threat to turtle populations. </p>
